# A Series of Visual Studio Solutions to Accompany the MSDN Tutorial Series about SharePoint-hosted Add-ins #

> SharePoint add-in model is considered as a legacy option for extending SharePoint user interface. Please see [SharePoint Framework documentation](https://aka.ms/spfx) and the [SharePoint Framework samples](https://aka.ms/spfx-webparts) for the future proven option to extend SharePoint Online. Possible backend services should be using Azure Active Directly based registration and related app models.

This repository is a series of *SharePoint-hosted* SharePoint Add-ins samples that are used with the tutorial series that begins with [Get started creating SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp142379.aspx).

# Overview #
This set of samples tracts the series of tutorials that begin at [Get started creating SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp142379.aspx). Each tutorial adds to the sample SharePoint add-in, **Employee Orientation**. This series of samples preserves the state of the add-in Visual Studio solution after each tutorial.
