# Overview #
This set of samples tracts the series of tutorials that begin at [Get started creating SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp142379.aspx). Each tutorial adds to the sample SharePoint add-in, **Employee Orientation**. This series of samples preserves the state of the add-in Visual Studio solution after each tutorial. Before beginning any tutorial, you can open the corresponding sample solution in Visual Studio and follow along. For example, to follow the tutorial [Add custom columns to a SharePoint-hosted add-in](), open the BeforeColumns.sln file in Visual Studio.
